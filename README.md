# Transportation Front-End: Freight and Expense Management

This project is aimed at learning programming and logical reasoning. The goal of the Transportation front-end system for managing freight and expenses for a transportation company is to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for truckers and transportation administrators to manage their freight and expenses in an efficient manner. Truckers can register new freight and track the status of ongoing freight while the administrator can approve or cancel the freight submitted by truckers. Additionally, truckers can register expenses and track the status of ongoing expenses while the administrator can approve or cancel the expenses submitted by truckers. The front-end of the system was built using Vue.js and should be responsive and accessible, allowing users to access the system from any device and easily navigate its functionalities.
